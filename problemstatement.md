Problem Statement
Build an AI workflow for the same product you selected in Milestone 1 that transforms raw customer feedback into a structured internal update and a ready-to-use customer communication.

Your system should:

Analyze recent user reviews to identify key product issues and themes
Detect a frequently misunderstood fee/charge from those insights
Generate:
A weekly internal product pulse
A standardized explanation for that specific fee
Finally, use MCP (with approval gating) to log and share this output across internal tools.

 The goal is to simulate a real Product + Support workflow where:

Product teams track user sentiment
Support teams proactively create clear explanations for recurring confusion
What You Must Build
Step 1 — Review Intelligence Layer
Input:

1 public reviews CSV (last 8–12 weeks)
Your system must:

Cluster reviews into max 5 themes
Identify top 3 themes
Extract 3 real user quotes
Highlight 1 recurring confusion/pain point related to a fee/charge
Step 2 — Weekly Product Pulse (Internal Output)
Using the insights above, generate a ≤250-word structured weekly note:

Summary of top themes
Supporting user quotes
Key observation (what’s going wrong / trending)
3 action ideas for the product team
Step 3 — Fee Explainer (Derived from Insights)
Using the identified confusion from Step 1, generate a structured explanation:

≤6 bullet points explaining the fee clearly
Written in a neutral, facts-only tone
Include 2 official source links
Add: “Last checked: ”
👉 Important: This is not a random scenario. It must directly connect to what users are confused about in reviews.

Required MCP Actions (Approval-Gated)
Once both outputs are generated:

1. Append to Notes/Doc
{

date,

top_themes,

weekly_pulse,

identified_fee_issue,

explanation_bullets,

source_links

}

2. Create Email Draft
Subject: Weekly Product Pulse + Customer Clarification —

Body:

Weekly product pulse
Fee explanation (as a reusable support snippet)
(No auto-send)

How to Implement MCP
You can use any of the following:

A tool like Zapier or Make
Function calling with an LLM
A simple simulated approval step (button or input prompt)
Minimum requirement:
Show a user approval step before taking any action
After approval:
Append output to a document (e.g., Google Docs or Notion)
Create an email draft (e.g., Gmail)
Example:
Reviews mention confusion about “exit load being charged unexpectedly”

→ Theme: Pricing confusion

→ Fee issue: Exit load misunderstanding

→ Output: Weekly pulse + exit load explanation + saved to doc + email draft

Deliverables
Working prototype link or ≤3-min demo video
